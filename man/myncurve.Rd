\title{Myncurve: Plot Normal Distribution and Compute Area Under the Curve}
\usage{
myncurve(mu = 0, sigma = 1, a, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{A numeric value representing the mean of the normal distribution (default is 0).}

\item{sigma}{A numeric value representing the standard deviation of the normal distribution (default is 1).}

\item{a}{A numeric value indicating the point up to which the area under the normal curve will be computed and shaded.}

\item{x}{A numeric vector for the x-values over which the normal distribution curve will be plotted.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{mu}{The mean of the normal distribution (input value).}
\item{sigma}{The standard deviation of the normal distribution (input value).}
\item{area}{The area (probability) under the normal curve from -âˆž to the specified point `a` (computed using `pnorm`).}
}
\description{
This function plots the normal distribution curve for a given mean (`mu`) and standard deviation (`sigma`),
and shades the area under the curve from negative infinity up to a specified value `a`. It also returns
the mean, standard deviation, and the computed probability (area) from negative infinity to `a`.
}
\details{
This function allows users to visualize the normal distribution and compute the cumulative probability
for any given value of `a`. The area under the curve represents the cumulative probability of obtaining a value
less than or equal to `a` for a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation.

\examples{
# Plot normal distribution with mu = 0, sigma = 1, and compute the area up to a = 1.5
myncurve(mu = 0, sigma = 1, a = 1.5, x = seq(-3, 3, by = 0.1))

# Plot normal distribution with mu = 2, sigma = 1, and compute the area up to a = 2.5
myncurve(mu = 2, sigma = 1, a = 2.5, x = seq(-1, 5, by = 0.1))
