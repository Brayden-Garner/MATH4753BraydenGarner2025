\title{Simulate Binomial Distribution Samples}
\usage{
mybin(iter = 100, n = 10, p = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{An integer. The number of simulations (iterations) to run.
Default is 100.}

\item{n}{An integer. The sample size (number of trials) for each simulation.
Default is 10.}

\item{p}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. The probability of success for each trial.
Default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
A vector of proportions of successes for each iteration.
         A bar plot is also displayed showing the distribution of successes.
}
\description{
This function simulates multiple binomial trials and generates a bar plot
showing the proportion of successes across all iterations. The function
allows you to control the number of iterations, sample size, and the
probability of success for each trial.
}
\examples{
# Simulate binomial distribution with default parameters
mybin()

# Simulate binomial distribution with 200 iterations, 50 trials per iteration, and success probability of 0.7
mybin(iter = 200, n = 50, p = 0.7)
